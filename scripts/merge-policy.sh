# merge-policy.sh — the executable predicate for "may Claude self-merge this PR?"
#
# Standing grant (CLAUDE.md › Merge & Branch Protocol): Claude merges its OWN green PRs into
# `main` WITHOUT asking. The single guardrail is the live public website: a merge to `main`
# auto-deploys the site/API *only* when the diff touches a deploy-trigger path. This script
# decides — by logic, never by memory — whether a given PR is cleared to merge.
#
#   exit 0  CLEARED — safe to `gh pr merge`. (A non-deploy PR that is mergeable, or a
#                     deploy-touching PR whose CI is fully GREEN + COMPLETE.)
#   exit 2  HOLD    — website-sensitive AND CI not yet green/complete, or the PR is a draft,
#                     or a non-deploy PR still has checks running. Wait for green; never
#                     blind-merge a live deploy.
#   exit 3  BLOCKED — GitHub itself refuses the merge right now: conflicts (DIRTY), stale base
#                     (BEHIND), or a branch-protection gate not satisfied (BLOCKED — e.g. the
#                     required `pr-gate` check hasn't run on a pre-existing PR). Rebase onto
#                     current main (the PR#111 silent-revert guard; also retriggers required
#                     checks), then re-run. Distinct from HOLD: HOLD means GitHub would allow
#                     the merge but the website-safety policy says wait; BLOCKED means it can't.
